=====================

Visual representation of ombenGame, a JavaScript card game that plays itself in the console.

Problem domain: 
Omben is a two-player card game similar to "Go Fish". Player 1 selects a card from his/her hand and asks Player 2 for any (and all) cards in Player's 2 hand that match the suit of Player 1's chosen card. If Player 2 does not have any cards with a matching suit, Player 1 must "drink" from the deck until Player 1 finds a suit match. 

If, during a player's turn, the player is in posession of 4 cards of matching suits, the player may discard those 4 cards into the face down pile. 

The first player to 0 cards wins, regardless of how many matched sets of 4 were made. 
If the deck reaches 0 cards, the player with fewer cards wins.
